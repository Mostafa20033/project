            <p><strong>The road of rams:</strong><ins>on November </ins>25, 2021, Egypt opened Rams Road to the public in the presence of Egyptian President<strong> Abdel Fattah al-Sisi</strong> in the city of Luxor amid great fanfare, after it completed the restoration work that took more than seven decades.
                The march included participants in pharaonic costumes, a symphony orchestra, light effects, professional dancers, boats on the Nile, and horse-drawn carriages
                At the beginning of the celebration, there were three “sacred” boats designed in the pharaonic style, walking in the heart of the Nile amid dazzling lights, and these “sacred boats” were designed in the Nile to symbolize the Holy Trinity of Thebes, Amun , Mut and Khonsu , which are the symbols of the Feast of the Epiphany of the ancient Egyptians.
                And the priests had to perform these rites twice a year: the first on the Feast of the Harvest, and the second on the Feast of the Ascension of the King. Thus, this road, which is called the Royal Processions Road , is the oldest religious ceremonial road in history.</p>

               <h1 class="name F1">(High Dam)</h1>
               <p .name>  The Aswan High Dam is one of the important tourist areas that tourists are keen to visit. The High Dam is distinguished by the grandeur of its design and historical importance, as well as the immensity of its architectural construction, at the global level during the twentieth century.
                
                
                 
                The goal of building this huge project is to protect the country from the floods of the Nile River, and to work to preserve it in the giant artificial lake reservoir for the time of need in the drought years. And the water from that lake is pushed through holes in the dam, to represent a terrible artificial waterfall, which rotates the turbines to generate electricity</p></p>
