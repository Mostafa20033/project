        Solovetsky Monastery was one of the most famous and sacred monasteries in Russia, and has become a major pilgrimage destination.
         It was also a place of exile, and in the 20th century it was used as a brutal Soviet prison camp in which over a million prisoners died.
      Soviet leaders in the 1920s saw the islands' isolation and stark climate differently and turned the archipelago into one of the country's first gulags.
       Still haunted by the shadows of victims who struggled with their political views in both imperial and Soviet times,
        yet its ancient monastery gives the place a unique air of spirituality.

       spiritual significance and heavy history attract tourists of all kinds to its shores. During World War II, the Solovetsky Islands were used as a naval base.
        The monastery reopened in the early 1990s and is once again home to a few monks.
